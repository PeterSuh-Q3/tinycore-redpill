 - GitHub ACTIONS-COOL Loader Auto Build Feature Distribution (Using Issues)

1. You must have a GitHub account.

https://github.com/

Create an account with Sign Up and then log in with Sign In.

2. If you write an issue in this issue, the loader will be automatically built based on the model in the content you wrote.

https://github.com/PeterSuh-Q3/tinycore-redpill/issues

This is using the GitHub ACTIONS-COOL build bot.

![21e6b8bb01a0f49b976a6f175173a8b1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f0385210-792f-4a82-b118-254926dbe0b3)

3. The title of the issue (the word custom must be included in the title.)

custom SA6400

The content of the main text is

{"model":"SA6400","version":"7.2.2-72806"}

Or

If you have a full-size serial and Mac address, please enter it in the following format. (Mac addresses are supported up to 4, mac4 only.)

{"model":"SA6400","version":"7.2.2-72806","mac1":"112233445566","mac2":"77889900aabb","sn":"1111222233333"}

If the Mac address and serial are omitted, they will be randomly generated.

You must write it in the form of a JSON body like this.

You can change the model and version, but if you make even the slightest mistake in spelling, the build will not be done properly.

4. Save the issue

If you go to the Actions side, you will see an orange icon and the loader build will proceed.

If you want to see the details, you can click on the workflow in progress.

If the loader build is successful, the workflow will turn green.

If you select Summary,

The artifact result, which is the loader file generated at the very bottom, is saved in the form of a zip file.

In this MshellImage-*.zip, the img file and vmdk file are each recompressed in tgz format.

The core content of this function is

Originally, you burn the official img of the TCRP-mshell loader to USB,

Enter ./menu.sh, select the model, version, serial, MAC address, etc., and go through manual build to complete the loader,

but this function is a function that allows you to receive an already completed loader from GitHub, bake it, and use it.

Since the Grub boot menu is created in the same way as when you manually build,

you can also build the loader created in this way by entering the manual build menu again.
